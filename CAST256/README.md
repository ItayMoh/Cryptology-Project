# cast-256-encryption
CAST-256 encryption, also known as CAST6, belongs to the family of block ciphers.

Cast-256 works with 128-bit blocks and keys of 128, 160, 192, 224, or 256 bits, providing flexibility in terms of key length.

CAST-256 uses a Feistel lattice structure, which divides the key into subkeys for each round of operation. It performs a number of rounds to securely shuffle the data

# File Explanation

1. Cast256.py : The cast256.py file contains encryption and decryption functions
- encrypt_block(message, key) : This function performs encryption of a 128-bit block by running successive rounds of the CAST-256 algorithm.
The encryption subkeys are generated using the key_generator function of the key_generator module.
The 12 rounds of encryption are performed by alternating between the forward_quad_round and reverse_quad_round functions
- decrypt_block(cipher, key): This function performs the decryption of a 128-bit block by performing successive rounds of the CAST-256 algorithm in reverse order.
The encryption subkeys are generated in the same way as with the cipher function.
The 12 rounds of decryption are performed by alternating between the forward_quad_round and reverse_quad_round functions.

2. function_cast256.py : The file function_cast256.py contains operations specific to each round (forward and reverse) of the CAST-256 algorithm
- table_substitution(block) : This function performs a substitution operation on a block of data, thus introducing confusion
- function1(d, kri, kmi) : This function corresponds to function 1 of CAST-256. It performs modulo sum, left shift, substitution (S-BOX), and XOR operations in a specific order.
- function2(d, kri, kmi) : This function corresponds to function 2 of CAST-256. It performs operations similar to function1, but in a different order.
- function3(d, kri, kmi) : This function corresponds to function 3 of CAST-256. It performs operations similar to function1 and function2, but in a different order.
- forward_quad_round(abcd, kr, km): This function corresponds to the encryption phase (forward_quad_round) of CAST-256. It decomposes a 128-bit block into four 32-bit blocks, then applies the functions specific to each round in a particular order. The intermediate results are recombined to form the output block.
- reverse_quad_round(abcd, kr, km): This function corresponds to the decryption phase (reverse_quad_round) of CAST-256. It decomposes a 128-bit block in the same way as the forward_quad_round function, but applies the functions in reverse order.
3. key_generator.py : The key_generator.py file contains operations specific to each octave of the CAST-256 algorithm
- forward_octave(abcdefgh, tr, tm) : This function corresponds to the octave phase of the CAST-256 encryption. It decomposes a 256-bit block into eight 32-bit blocks, then applies the functions specific to each round in a particular order. The intermediate results are recombined to form the output block.
- initialization() : This function initializes the rotation keys tr and mask keys tm needed to generate the CAST-256 keys. It creates two two-dimensional arrays (8x24) containing the rotation and mask keys respectively.
- key_generator(key) : This function generates the rotation keys kr and mask keys km for the CAST-256 encryption from the encryption key (256 bits). It uses the rotation and mask keys generated by the initialization function and applies specific operations to obtain the necessary rotation and mask keys.

4. mode_operation.py : The mode_operation.py file contains functions for the ECB (Electronic Codebook) and CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) modes of operation for encryption and decryption with the CAST-256 algorithm.
- rdm_iv_generator() : Generates a random 128-bit initialization vector (IV)
- encrypt_ecb(blocks, key) : Encrypts a list of blocks using the Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode of operation with the CAST-256 algorithm.
- decrypt_ecb(blocks, key) : Decrypts a list of encrypted blocks using the Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode of operation with the CAST-256 algorithm.
- encrypt_cbc(blocks, key) : Encrypts a list of blocks using the Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) operation mode with the CAST-256 algorithm.
- decrypt_cbc(blocks, key) : Decrypts a list of encrypted blocks using the Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) operation mode with the CAST-256 algorithm.
- decrypt(blocks, key, operation_mode="ECB") : Decrypts a list of blocks using the CAST-256 operation mode.
